#### Who
My name is Kevin Cashman.  I studied Computer Science at Virginia Tech, and now
I work as a software engineer in Austin, Texas.

#### What
This blog is intended to be the primary representation of my internet indentity.
I plan on using this space to share my thoughts and ideas.  Plus, I need something
to put on my business cards.

#### Where
I currently live in work in Austin, TX. I grew up in Hampton Roads, VA.

#### When
This blog started in Spring, 2015.

#### Why
I have been a voracious reader of blogs and listener of podcasts for years.
There are more than a few people and companies I follow whom I have never met,
and would never know if not for their online presence. Following their example,
I want to have my ideas online so that anyone who is interested can find them,
even if we might never meet in person.
